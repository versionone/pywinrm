# pywinrm [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/diyan/pywinrm.png)](https://travis-ci.org/diyan/pywinrm) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/diyan/pywinrm)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/diyan/pywinrm) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/diyan/pywinrm/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/diyan/pywinrm)

pywinrm is a Python client for the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service.
It allows you to invoke commands on target Windows machines from any machine
that can run Python.

WinRM allows you to perform various management tasks remotely. These include, 
but are not limited to: running batch scripts, powershell scripts, and fetching 
WMI variables.

Used by [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) for Windows support.

For more information on WinRM, please visit
[Microsoft's WinRM site](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384426.aspx).

## Requirements
* Linux, Mac OS X or Windows
* CPython 2.6-2.7, 3.3-3.5 or PyPy2
* [requests-kerberos](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests-kerberos) and [requests-credssp](https://github.com/jborean93/requests-credssp) is optional

## Installation
### To install pywinrm with support for basic, certificate, and NTLM auth, simply
```bash
$ pip install pywinrm
```

### To use Kerberos authentication you need these optional dependencies

```bash
# for Debian/Ubuntu/etc:
$ sudo apt-get install gcc python-dev libkrb5-dev
$ pip install pywinrm[kerberos]

# for RHEL/CentOS/etc:
$ sudo yum install gcc python-devel krb5-devel krb5-workstation
$ pip install pywinrm[kerberos]
```

### To use CredSSP authentication you need these optional dependencies

```bash
# for Debian/Ubuntu/etc:
$ sudo apt-get install gcc python-dev libssl-dev
$ pip install pywinrm[credssp]

# for RHEL/CentOS/etc:
$ sudo yum install gcc python-devel openssl-devel
$ pip install pywinrm[credssp]
```

## Example Usage
### Run a process on a remote host
```python
import winrm

s = winrm.Session('windows-host.example.com', auth=('john.smith', 'secret'))
r = s.run_cmd('ipconfig', ['/all'])
>>> r.status_code
0
>>> r.std_out
Windows IP Configuration

   Host Name . . . . . . . . . . . . : WINDOWS-HOST
   Primary Dns Suffix  . . . . . . . :
   Node Type . . . . . . . . . . . . : Hybrid
   IP Routing Enabled. . . . . . . . : No
   WINS Proxy Enabled. . . . . . . . : No
...
>>> r.std_err

```

NOTE: pywinrm will try and guess the correct endpoint url from the following formats:

 - windows-host -> http://windows-host:5985/wsman
 - windows-host:1111 -> http://windows-host:1111/wsman
 - http://windows-host -> http://windows-host:5985/wsman
 - http://windows-host:1111 -> http://windows-host:1111/wsman
 - http://windows-host:1111/wsman -> http://windows-host:1111/wsman


### Run Powershell script on remote host

```python
import winrm

ps_script = """$strComputer = $Host
Clear
$RAM = WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem
$MB = 1048576

"Installed Memory: " + [int]($RAM.TotalPhysicalMemory /$MB) + " MB" """

s = winrm.Session('windows-host.example.com', auth=('john.smith', 'secret'))
r = s.run_ps(ps_script)
>>> r.status_code
0
>>> r.std_out
Installed Memory: 3840 MB

>>> r.std_err

```

Powershell scripts will be base64 UTF16 little-endian encoded prior to sending to the Windows host. Error messages are converted from the Powershell CLIXML format to a human readable format as a convenience.

### Run process with low-level API with domain user, disabling HTTPS cert validation

```python
from winrm.protocol import Protocol

p = Protocol(
    endpoint='https://windows-host:5986/wsman',
    transport='ntlm',
    username=r'somedomain\someuser',
    password='secret',
    server_cert_validation='ignore')
shell_id = p.open_shell()
command_id = p.run_command(shell_id, 'ipconfig', ['/all'])
std_out, std_err, status_code = p.get_command_output(shell_id, command_id)
p.cleanup_command(shell_id, command_id)
p.close_shell(shell_id)
```

### Valid transport options

pywinrm supports various transport methods in order to authenticate with the WinRM server. The options that are supported in the `transport` parameter are;
* `basic`: Basic auth only works for local Windows accounts not domain accounts. Credentials are base64 encoded when sending to the server.
* `plaintext`: Same as basic auth.
* `certificate`: Authentication is done through a certificate that is mapped to a local Windows account on the server.
* `ssl`: When used in conjunction with `cert_pem` and `cert_key_pem` it will use a certificate as above. If not will revert to basic auth over HTTPS.
* `kerberos`: Will use Kerberos authentication for domain accounts which only works when the client is in the same domain as the server and the required dependencies are installed. Currently a Kerberos ticket needs to be initiliased outside of pywinrm using the kinit command.
* `ntlm`: Will use NTLM authentication for both domain and local accounts.
* `credssp`: Will use CredSSP authentication for both domain and local accounts. Allows double hop authentication. This only works over a HTTPS endpoint and not HTTP.

### Encryption

By default WinRM will not accept unencrypted messages from a client and Pywinrm
currently has 2 ways to do this.

1. Using a HTTPS endpoint instead of HTTP (Recommended)
2. Use NTLM as the transport auth and setting `message_encryption` to `auto` or `always`

Using a HTTPS endpoint is recommended as it will encrypt all the data sent
through to the server including the credentials and works with all transport
auth types. You can use [this script](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1)
to easily set up a HTTPS endpoint on WinRM with a self signed certificate but
in a production environment this should be hardened with your own process.

The second option is to use NTLM and set the `message_encryption` arg to
protocol to `auto` or `always`. This will use the authention GSS-API Wrap and
Unwrap methods if available to encrypt the message contents sent to the server.
This form of encryption is independent from the transport layer like TLS and is
currently only supported by the NTLM transport auth. Kerberos and CredSSP do
have the methods available but currently are not supported in Pywinrm.

To configure message encryption you can use the `message_encryption` argument
when initialising protocol. This option has 3 values that can be set as shown
below.

* `auto`: Default, Will only use message encryption if it is available for the auth method and HTTPS isn't used.
* `never`: Will never use message encryption even when not over HTTPS.
* `always`: Will always use message encryption evevn when running over HTTPS.

If you set the value to `always` and the transport opt doesn't support message
encryption i.e. Basic auth, Pywinrm will throw an exception.

If you do not use a HTTPS endpoint or message encryption then the Windows
server will automatically reject Pywinrm. You can change the settings on the
Windows server to allow unencrypted messages and credentials but this highly
insecure and shouldn't be used unless necessary. To allow unencrypted message
run the following command either from cmd or powershell

```
# from cmd
winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}

# or from powershell
Set-Item -Path "WSMan:\localhost\Service\AllowUnencrypted" -Value $true
```

As a repeat this should definitely not be used as your credentials and messages
will allow anybody to see what is sent over the wire.


### Enabling WinRM on remote host
Enable WinRM over HTTP and HTTPS with self-signed certificate (includes firewall rules):

```
# from powershell:
Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1'))
```

Enable WinRM over HTTP for test usage (includes firewall rules):
```
winrm quickconfig
```

Enable WinRM basic authentication. For domain users, it is necessary to use NTLM, Kerberos or CredSSP authentication (Kerberos and NTLM authentication are enabled by default CredSSP isn't).
```
# from cmd:
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
```

Enable WinRM CredSSP authentication. This allows double hop support so you can authenticate with a network service when running command son the remote host. This command is run in Powershell.
```powershell
Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Server -Force
Set-Item -Path "WSMan:\localhost\Service\Auth\CredSSP" -Value $true
```
